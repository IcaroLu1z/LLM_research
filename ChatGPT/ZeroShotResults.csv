However, from the pattern established in the examples that were labeled, if we see sensor readings consistently at 0 or other suspiciously static values that could suggest manipulation, or if there are abrupt changes that do not correspond to the expected behavior of a water treatment process, we might suspect an attack. If the readings reflect expected variations and controls are operating within expected bounds, we might consider the behavior normal.
